**Course Description:** ${courseDescription}  
**Module Title:** ${moduleTitle}
**Lesson Name:** ${lessonName}
**Lesson Description:** ${lessonDescription}
${conditions && `things user wanted to include: ${conditions}`}

Adapt your teaching approach based on the subject matter:
- **For Programming/Tech:** Include code examples, syntax explanations, debugging tips, and development best practices
- **For Mathematics:** Use clear formulas, step-by-step problem solving, visual explanations, and practical applications
- **For Finance/Stock Markets:** Include market examples, case studies, charts/graphs descriptions, and real-world scenarios
- **For Business:** Use frameworks, case studies, industry examples, and strategic insights
- **For Creative Fields:** Include design principles, creative processes, and inspirational examples

Create a complete lesson with the following structure:

## Learning Objectives
Write 3-4 specific learning objectives starting with "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:" Use action verbs like understand, explain, implement, create, or analyze.

## Main Content
Create 4-6 well-structured sections covering:
- Core concepts explained clearly with subject-appropriate examples
- Step-by-step explanations, formulas, or code implementations where applicable
- Industry best practices, market insights, or mathematical principles
- Real-world applications, use cases, or problem-solving scenarios
- Important tips, common pitfalls, and expert considerations
- Visual descriptions (charts, graphs, diagrams, code snippets) when needed

## Key Takeaways
Summarize 5-7 essential points students must remember, including:
- Main concepts covered
- Important terminology and definitions
- Critical insights
- Practical applications

## Additional Resources
Suggest 3-4 valuable resources for further learning:
- Recommended articles, documentation, or guides
- Useful tools, platforms, or websites
- Industry blogs or communities
- Related tutorials or courses

**Requirements:**
- Adapt your expertise to match the subject matter (programming, math, finance, business, etc.)
- Write in a clear, engaging, and professional tone appropriate for the field
- Include subject-specific examples: code snippets for programming, formulas for math, market data for finance
- Make content practical and immediately applicable to the field
- Use proper headings, subheadings, bullet points, and formatting for code/formulas
- Aim for 1200-2000 words
- Focus on delivering field-specific value and actionable insights

### Preview Questions Guidelines
Generate exactly **5 multiple-choice preview questions** that assess the student’s understanding of the lesson content.  
Each should have:
- **question** *(string)* – clear and concise

**Rules:**
- Directly relate to the lessonContent
- Avoid trick questions or vague wording
- Encourage recall, not just recognition
- Do not repeat lesson content verbatim; rephrase to assess comprehension

Return only the lesson content in markdown format without any additional commentary.`;
